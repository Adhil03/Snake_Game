## Introduction

Snake Game is a simple project created to explore game development using Python.
It serves as a fun way to learn about basic game mechanics, collision detection, and user input handling.

## How to Play

* The goal of Snake Game is to control the snake using the arrow keys and eat as many snacks as possible 
without hitting the boundaries of the game window or running into yourself.
